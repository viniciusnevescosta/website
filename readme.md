## About

This is my personal website, built on top of [Mark Horn’s Astro Nano theme](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano).

I adapted it to fit my own needs, adding a few features and UX improvements along the way.

What I changed / added
- [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com) for the user interface;
- [Bun](https://bun.com) for runtime and package manager;
- [Flexoki](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki) theme palette;
- Custom Obsidian plugin to edit content from the app;
- Photo page to publish and organize my photography;
- Image viewer component for a better browsing experience;
- New theme selector UX (cleaner and more intuitive);
- RSS reader improvements and small fixes for better compatibility.
