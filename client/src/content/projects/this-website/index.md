Since I started learning programming, development, and design back in 2019, I’ve always wanted to build my own personal website. I wanted a place to showcase my skills, track what I was learning, share my projects, and publish thoughts and opinions — something that felt truly mine.

And I actually did it… a few times. Each version reflects a different stage of my journey:

## My first page

This was my very first website — and also my first contribution on GitHub. It started as a school project: simple HTML and basically no real understanding of CSS. At the time, I was excited just to have something online, but it didn’t take long for me to feel like it wasn’t “me” yet. It worked, but it looked rough, and I knew I could do better.

Not long after, I made a second version — also for school. It still didn’t have much CSS (I was learning slowly), but I tried to be more creative with the idea. I wanted to tell a story, not just display information. It was definitely an improvement, but I still wasn’t satisfied. I could feel the gap between what I imagined and what I was able to build.

## My portfolio

This one was different: it wasn’t for school — it was personal. By then, I finally had a better grasp of CSS, and I could build layouts that looked intentional. I used this website for a while and it did its job as a portfolio, but deep down I still felt it was incomplete. Something about it didn’t fully represent where I wanted to go.

## This website

Eventually, I decided to start over again — this time with a custom template and a clearer concept.

Life also changed. I had new responsibilities, less free time, and I had to rethink what I actually wanted from a personal website. Over time, I learned a lot more: better design decisions, better organization, better tools, better standards — and a better understanding of myself as a developer.

Now, for the first time, I can honestly say I’m completely satisfied with it.

This website is not just a portfolio anymore. It’s a living space: a home for my work, my notes, my experiments, and the things I care about — built slowly, intentionally, and with more meaning than any version before.
