title: The post that broke my website
description: How a Reddit post took down my website.

I decided to write this to review and share some insights about my latest post.

Last Tuesday, I posted an article entitled [‘2030 the year of desktop Linux’](https://viniciusnevescosta.com/blog/2030-the-year-of-desktop-linux). The "year of the Linux desktop" is a well-known meme in the community, mostly because this year never really comes. But I suggested in the title that 2030 might actually be the _"promised year."_

I argued that, utilizing some work-in-progress projects, the ecosystem may be mature enough for the average user in the next 4 years—a thought that I had been mulling over for some while.

But to be fair, what I wasn’t expecting was the repercussions that post caused.

I decided to share the link on the [r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/) subreddit with a discussion tag. In less than 30 minutes, the post got 20k views and 50 comments.

Fast forward to today, and the post is closing in on 100k views and nearing 200 comments.

The influx was so sudden that it actually took my site down for a few hours. I completely blew past my hosting traffic limit. It was a bittersweet moment: a mix of "Yay, people are reading!" followed by "Oh no, nobody can read it anymore."

I think the reaction was largely driven by the title I chose for Reddit: [_“Why desktop Linux could just feel normal by 2030.”_](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qosj0w/why_desktop_linux_could_just_feel_normal_by_2030/) It was a simple, innocent, yet clearly provocative title.

A lot of people commented to say that Linux is _already_ normal today. And yes, I agree. It is normal for me, and likely for you reading this. Knowing what I know now, I might have chosen a title that made my idea clearer—perhaps emphasizing "frictionless" rather than just "normal"—to better reflect that I was talking about the experience for the average, non-technical consumer.

However, despite the semantic debate, the main goal was achieved: to generate a healthy discussion around the incredible engineering work being done right now.

Thank you to everyone who read, commented, and engaged.

Regarding what’s next: as I hinted before, I’m planning a piece on Mac gaming. And over the next few months, I want to explore a handful of other topics too—still in the same style: a technical deep dive first, and then some predictions based on what I find.

Here are a few ideas currently on my list:
- What if Windows became open source?
- Web Applications
- Linux and mobile
- Storage
- Modern cryptography
- WireGuard

These are all topics I genuinely enjoy and want to dig into. But, this isn’t a strict roadmap and they're not in a sequential order. Also, other subjects may show up along the way.

It might take a little while to write and publish these topics because my routine is currently packed with work and university, but stay tuned.
